## Overview
This is a Flask web app which predicts fare of Flight ticket.

## Motivation
Anyone who has booked a flight ticket knows how unexpectedly the prices vary.So, if we could inform the travellers with the optimal time to buy their flight tickets based on the historic data and also show them various trends in the airline industry we could help them save money on their travels. This would be a practical implementation of a data analysis, statistics and machine learning techniques to solve a daily problem faced by traveller.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.6.10. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deployement on Heroku
Login or signup in order to create virtual app. You can either connect your github profile or download ctl to manually deploy this project.

Our next step would be to follow the instruction given on [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) to deploy a web app.

Finally, we have created a User Interface for the entire process of buying an airline ticket and given a proof of our predictions based on the previous trends with our prediction.

## Bug / Feature Request

If you find a bug (the website couldn't handle the query and / or gave undesired results), kindly open an [issue](https://github.com/Mandal-21/Flight-Price-Prediction/issues) here by including your search query and the expected result

## Future Scope

* Use multiple Algorithms
* Optimize Flask app.py
* Front-End 
* With a high probability that a person has to wait to buy a ticket, the scope of the project can be extensively extended across the various routes to make significant savings on the purchase of flight prices across the Indian Domestic Airline market.
 In this project we simulate various models for computing expected future prices and classifying whether this is the best time to buy the ticket.
